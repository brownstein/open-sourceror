for basic functions, I need to:
- calculate size (radians) of each segment at current radius
- adjust radius to handle overages proportionally'
- repeat a few times

for functions with nested functions, I need to:
- calculate sub-functions first
-- should not need to re-calculate afterwards, as circles will be fully sized
- run re-flow on parent circles and recurse up

example:

initial radian allocations of:
[  4  ][ 2 ][    5    ] / 6.28 @ radius 15
after radius increase becomes:
[ 3 ][ 1.5 ][  4  ]... / 6.28 @ radius 20

- need classes for:
-- layout and meshing phase
-- iteration phase
